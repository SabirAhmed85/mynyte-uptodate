                        In partnership with BlueRock Productions, MyDay can offer you specialised Search Engine Optimisation services that tie-in completely to your website itself (an important aspect of SEO) and will only go to multiply and magnify your efforts to buid an online presence.
                    </span>

                        <h4><span>Start with the basics of SEO</span></h4>
                        
                        <p>As a pre-requisite with any new SEO client, MyDay and BlueRock Productions will always begin by conduction a full SEO audit on your website.</p>
                        <p>The first thing this means is analysing the raw codebase of your website to ensure that it's been built with SEO in mind. This would involve looking for clean coding, a strong informational hierarchy and good image optimisation/configuration. An audit such as this is the best way to ensure that you're starting out your Search Engine Optimisation efforts on the best note.</p>
                        <ul><li><i class="fa fa-star"></i>Full SEO audit for free</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i>Analysis of competitors &amp; industry</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Once this audit is complete, MyDay will help and talk you through the results of our website inspection. From here, we will be able to outline a clear action-plan to go forward with, all while helping you to understand the more complex technical aspects.</p>

                        <p>After your SEO-friendly website is created (or reconfigured to match your SEO needs), it will then become important to create a way of working which means you are regularly making additions/ammendments to your website in a way that aids your Google and Search Engine ranking.</p>
                        <p>As you may have heard, good SEO is considered more of a marathon than a sprint, which means that a strong Search Engine Optimisation campaign is really a long-term gameplan. This is where MyDay can really help, as we're happy to take on the hassle of the ongoing maintenance on your behalf.</p>

                        <p>For businesses that are really trying to push their brand out and take their marketing efforts all the way, there are of course various methods and ways to engage in online advertising, particularly through the major search engines such as Google and Bing.</p>
                        <p>Whilst there is plenty of loose information on the internet about paid advertising campaigns, PPC campaigns and Google Adwords, many businesses often find themselves overwhelmed by all the different viewpoints and talking points on offer.

Our main focus is always transparency and openness towards our clients, so we always make it our main focus to ensure that you as a business really feel comfortable about any of the services we're performing on your behalf.</p>
