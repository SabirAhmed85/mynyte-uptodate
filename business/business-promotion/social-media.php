                        <h4><span>Start with the essential Account Creation</span></h4>
                        
                        <p>The first step in co-ordinating your Social Media campaign efforts would be to begin the process of account creation. MyDay conduct this part of the process on behalf of our clients, but we also focus on transparency at every stage. This means we always approach the process with a plan, approved by yourself, and we always make sure to keep you in the loop during the process.</p>
                        <ul><li><i class="fa fa-star"></i>Consultation &amp; account creation plan</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i>Recommendations on 'Username', key assets</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-star"></i>Design tips to help you decide how to style your pages</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i>Creation of assets, like stylish 'Profile' &amp; 'Cover' photos etc</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After this, MyDay would then begin to flesh out your newly created Social Media accounts by uploading and applying your best artwork and designs to them. We even go further to recommend create specific artwork for you, to suit the rquirements of the specific platforms.</p>

                        <p>After the initial account creation is done, you get to the nitty-gritty. At this point, MyDay would start to flesh out your approach to social media and create an action plan to go forward with. To do this we would take a range of factors into account - analysis of your target market, user behaviours &amp; trends, your competitors etc - and would then be able to create a detailed routine/workflow that would aim to achieve your main targets in the market.</p>

                        <p>Whilst good marketing campaigns and initiatives are crucial to the success of any company's Social Networking objectives, the most important thing is perhaps the ability to stay informaed and aware of changing formats and techniques.</p>
                        <p>Social Networks regularly change their features &amp; functions, and as a business that aims to utilise this type of media to help you gain exposure, it's essential for you to know exactly how you can use every new feature and function to your benefit. If there's a particular technique out there that will help you get followers, you should know.</p>
