                        MyNyte &amp; MyDay are two fresh &amp; innovative apps that really put business &amp; commerce at the centre of focus. Based in Bedford to begin with, the MyNyte app is an all-in-one evening planning app, and MyDay is it's daytime equivalent. Read on to find out just how the MyNyte &amp; MyDay apps work, and to learn exactly how they can help your business.

                        <p>The MyDay &amp; MyNyte apps are all-in-one daytime &amp; evening planning apps, based in Bedford to begin with and very soon to expand into nearby areas. They're apps aimed members of the local population: users log in to see what events/activities are going on around them, and also to find out about local businesses. After this, users can also book transactions with those businesses, like booking hairdresser appointments (with MyDay) or booking restaurant tables (with MyNyte), for instance - at the touch of just a few buttons.</p>
                        <ul><li><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i>Fresh &amp; innovative new apps</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-star"></i>Tap into a whole new market/crowd</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i>Great local feedback &amp; anticipation, both from businesses who are signed up, and also non-business users</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The MyDay &amp; MyNyte apps are completely fresh new concepts, and we've had great local feedback around them so far, both from businesses and consumers, and so we're confident that in time the apps will both become very popular platforms by which people will engage with the businesses around them. You could use this to your advantage now, and get ahead of the game early by beginning to tap into a whole new market - in other words, <em>let MyDay &amp; MyNyte bring the crowd to you</em>.</p>

                        <h4><span>Locally focused apps to help you reach the most relevant Audience</span></h4>
                        
                        <p>Since local commerce and business is the primary focus of the apps, they're both equipped with a vast array of functionality &amp; tools based on helping users find information relevant to them and their local area. The various feeds on the apps are split by Town/City, as we know how effective and useful this is for the average user.</p>
                        <p>When users search for business information, the geographical location is the single most important factor in most of their decisions. That means your business should aim to ensure that whatever marketing or promotion efforts you are engaging in, you should always make sure that the information is geographically relevant to the user.</p>
                        <p>It is in this way, with geographical targeting, that MyDay and MyNyte really excel. Since the apps are based around allowing users to find out about things to do in their area for the day/evening, the app is entirely geared towards making it as easy as possible to get local business information onto a users phone/tablet. Users will be logging on to search for things to do and businesses to transact with, and you could ensure that your own business benefits from that.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-star"></i>Listings/Feeds based on Town/City</li>

                        <h4><span>Build your own Following for more Customer Loyalty</span></h4>
                        <p>MyDay believe it's imporant for us to let businesses flourish and thrive on our platforms. We want to create an atmosphere where companies feel comfortable in advertising their services, safe in the knowledge that they are also slowly building up their own loyal following, as opposed to becoming an insignificant cog in a bigger machine.</p>
                        <p>To help us put the focus back onto businesses, our developers have also added various design elements and features which heavily encourage users to 'Follow' the accounts/companies that they like. This not only means that users can stay up to date with the local outlets that are appealing to them, but it also means your business is able to create and nurture it's own identity and loyal fan-base: massively enhancing your customer loyalty in the long-term.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-star"></i>Create &amp; nurture your own identity</li>

                            <li><i class="fa fa-star"></i>Communicate directly with your followers about new offers or events</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After you've built your following, communicating directly with them then becomes a piece of cake. They'll be updated about your new Offers and Events etc as soon as you upload them.</p>

                        <p>As business focused apps, both MyDay and MyNyte have been carefully crafted and engineered by highly experienced developers, and their main focus was to ensure that the app was easy for customers to use and book transactions with. All this means that it's been built in the best way possible to help businesses, and to allow them to get more bookings/custom.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Not only can you start accepting bookings with ease through both the apps, but you'll also get access to your own personal Control Panel, where you can monitor the bookings at your own pace. You can even plan &amp; schedule for the future, and very soon you'll also be able to assign bookings and tasks to your different staff members.</p>
                        <p>As an added bonus for joining MyDay/MyNyte, you also get direct access to our extensive range of <a href="../web/">Website Enhancements</a>, which allow you to add extremely sophisticated and powerful booking functionality to your website, at a fraction of the typically expected cost, just by connecting your MyDay/MyNyte account to your website.</p>

                        <p>With MyDay &amp; MyNyte's tools around location selection, MyDay/MyNyte users are easily able to specify which particular town/city they would like to receive information about. A large part of the focus of the apps is based around giving users locally relevant information, to ensure it's completely relevant, and in line with this all the businesses already on MyDay/MyNyte are currently able to really connect with the crowd in their local area.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-star"></i>Create &amp; update special offers &amp; images easily</li>

                            <li><i class="fa fa-star"></i>Let users share &amp; send your offers/images to their friends</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For instance, the 'Offers Feeds' list all the latest local offers to our users, separating them by category for easy access - and these are a great way for local businesses to attract customers looking to engage in specific kinds of activities - from users looking for restaurant offers, to others looking for good drinks deals in town. As well as this, users are given the chance to send and share these offers with their friends at the touch of a button, meaning that details about your Special Offers could be going viral in your local town.</p>
                        <!--
                        <p>Your images can also play a big part in helping you spread the word about your business, and uploading images onto the MyDay/MyNyte apps is easy. After this, it's even simpler for users to then start sharing your best images with their friends in the chat function, and on outside apps like Whatsapp etc.</p>
                        -->

                        <p>As a member of MyDay/MyNyte, you can now even start to bring the powerful and amazingly easy-to-use functionality of the apps straight into your website. For example, once you've entered your menu items into the app, it then becomes very easy for us to implement that menu into your own website, so you can show it to your own customers &amp; users very easily. You can also do the same for your Appointment Booking etc, by introduced a small Appointment Booking panel into your site - and all it would take is a very small amount of effort on the part of our developers.</p>
